Google Books Search App built with React

## Description
MERN Stack (React, MongoDB, Express, Node.js) application that allows users to search for new book titles using the Google Books API. Once a user searches for books, they are presented with information and the option to save the titles to their Saved list. Once saved, the book information is saved to the MongoDB backend so that they can access the title later. They can also link to the Google Books page for each book to preview/buy the titles they'd like to read.
